- **Target Coverage**: 85%
- **Final Coverage**: 89%
- **Improvement**: +7%

## New Tests Added

We added the following tests to improve coverage:

1. **test_file_save_exception_handling**: Tests handling of exceptions during file saving in the upload route.
2. **test_missing_filepath_in_process_pdf**: Tests processing of non-existent files in the `process_pdf` function.
3. **test_results_with_empty_pdf_data**: Tests the results route with empty PDF data.
4. **test_exception_in_results_data_processing**: Tests error handling in the results route when processing invalid data structures.
5. **test_view_page_complete_flow**: Tests the complete flow of the view_page route with mocked PDF data.
6. **test_file_deletion_error_handling**: Tests error handling during file deletion in the new_search route.
7. **test_error_in_template_rendering**: Tests error handling during template rendering in the results route.
8. **test_allowed_file_no_extension**: Tests the `allowed_file` function with various edge cases.
9. **test_upload_disallowed_file**: Tests uploading files with disallowed extensions.
10. **test_exception_in_file_removal**: Tests exception handling during file removal in the cleanup process.
11. **test_process_pdf_exception_handling**: Tests exception handling in the `process_pdf` function.
12. **test_exception_in_file_saving**: Tests exception handling during file saving in the upload route.

## Areas Now Covered

1. Error handling in the `allowed_file` function
2. Error handling during file saving
3. Exception handling in PDF processing
4. Error handling in results route
5. Exception handling in the results template rendering
6. Page view functionality

## Remaining Uncovered Areas (11%)

Some lines remain uncovered (24 of 211 lines), including:
- Lines 43-45: Some edge cases in the `allowed_file` function
- Lines 173-175, 316-317: Some file operation error paths
- Lines 200-205, 219-221, 244: Some error handling in PDF processing
- Lines 270-275: Template rendering error handling
- Line 341: Exception handling in cleanup process

## Conclusion

We have successfully improved the code coverage beyond the target of 85%. The additional tests focus on edge cases, error handling, and exception paths, which are critical for ensuring the application's robustness. This improvement will help catch potential issues earlier in the development process and ensure that the application gracefully handles unexpected situations.
